# Studio 0

## Part 1: Markdown Practice

The first part of this studio is practice with Markdown. Complete each of the following exercises:

You can preview what your Markdown file will look like when styles are added by using Particle Desktop's Markdown Preview feature. To do so:
1. Go to the `Packages` Menu.
1. Select the `Markdown Preview` submenu.
1. Select `Toggle Preview` (You may also want to make a note of the shortcut keys listed so you can quickly open the preview in the future).

***Q1. The above paragraph and this sentence use markdown in a few ways.  Give a brief description of anything unusual you notice.  Just enter your description on the lines below:***

In the preview, each listed item is prefaced with '1', but in the markdown preview, appears as an ordered list going from 1-3. The words between single quotes are highlighted in blue in the .md file, but are highlighted and in a different font in the markdown preview. Finally, preceding 'Q1'and at the end of the sentence are three *** which italicizes the sentence in both the .md file and the markdown preview.

### Lists

Create a numbered list of five of your favorite foods in-order from favorite to least favorite in the designated area below. Be sure to include at least two things that are made of multiple ingredients.  

For each item that has multiple ingredients, create a sub list of a few (2-5) of the ingredients.  Make one of the sub-lists numbered and the other should use bullet points. (It should look like an outline: The ingredients for item n are indented and immediately below item n, but before item n+1)

***Q2. Create your list here:***

1. Chocolate Chip cookies
1. Pizza
  * cheese  
  * bread
1. fruit salad
  * strawberries
  * grapes
  * I could say 'fruit and salad' as ingredients to be funny
1. naan
1. chicken in any form

### Headings

Headings and sub-headings help separate the content of a document.

***Q3. Add a new third tier heading to this document named "My Heading" here:***

### My Heading

yuh

### Code

Markdown is often used to document code.  Consequently, it supports embedding code within documents.

***Q4. Create a code block below and include a Java `for`-loop that prints numbers from 0 to 10. Be sure to indicate that it's Java, which will cause Java keywords to be highlighted (for example, depending on your configuration `for` may be purple in the preview window; `int` may be orange, etc.):***

```java
#basic for loop here:
for (int v = 0; v < 11; v++) {
  System.out.println(v);
}
```
## Part 2: What is IoT

This class is about IoT.  [Postscapes](https://www.postscapes.com/internet-of-things-examples/) has a list of examples of IoT.  Pick any three categories (Body, Home City, Industry, etc.) and review any one example of each.

***Q5.  Based on your reviews, create a table of the top four distinguishing features of IoT applications. One column of the table should have a brief name for the feature (1-4 words) and the second column should have an explanation:***

feature | explanation
------- | ------------
online | because the data for each device feeds into the cloud, or to a location where the user can easily access it.
portable, or widespread | IoT devices are meant to be easily accessible, widespread, or portable so they can be more common in everyday situations for logging data and providing functionality.
intelligence | autonomous features are pretty significant for efficient operability of IoT devices.
location tracking | IoT devices usually have their locations tracked as data used for improving functionality, performance, or for other reasons. For the goal of widespread interconnectivity, tracking location is a common IoT feature.



Search for some additional IoT examples at other sites and find two examples that you find interesting.

***Q6.  For each example: 1) provide a link to it, 2) provide a brief summary of it, and 3) explain how it corresponds to distinguishing features you identified above and/or or how you may want to revise your list of distinguishing features.  Use lists/sublists to format your answer to this question (A numbered list of 2 items, each of which as 3 sub-items):***

1. Wemo Bridge (smart home connector)     
  * https://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F7C074/?gclid=CjwKCAjwwo7cBRBwEiwAMEoXPLcXXEkV8XZZP7CnK0SFpM3joOJ89kAKQV4CtBxUXWdXGMDo-AzSlRoCC7AQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds
  * Allows users to connect to their Wemo devices with an Apple HomeKit as per the information in the following link. The adapter allows users to connect and control their smart homes from any Apple device, and it allows control of light switches and other outlets.
  * usable on phones (accessibility), online, new feature not on other list: connects to and can modify behavior of other devices. Connectivity is a new feature I would add to the list.
1. Apple Watch!
  *  https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-3/?afid=p238%7CsJKznVXu8-dc_mtid_20925qtb42335_pcrid_260187741003&cid=wwa-us-kwgo-watch-slid--
  * apple watch: Allows users to connect and utilize a wealth of applications on their wrists, like phone/iMessage, GroupMe, fitness apps, and many many more.
  * portable (you wear it on your wrist), online (connects to data/phone), has location tracking (see previous)

## Part 3: Comparing with Peers

Compare your previous work with other people in the class and try to come to a consensus about what IoT is about.

***Q7. Meet someone new.  Find a class member who you don't already know and introduce yourself.  Compare your work conclusions to the above IoT questions. Again, using a list indicate: 1) Who you worked with, and 2) Any discrepancies or interesting observations that arise from comparing your work:***

1. Grace Hass-Hill
  * IoT devices are extremely widespread and are rapidly expanding their reach in both connectivity and data, and also physically.

1. Jessica Thoelke
  * They're automated and designed to do menial, everyday work for the user. Meant to be beneficial and save energy.

***Q8. Meet someone else new.  Find another class member who you don't already know and introduce your self.  Again compare your work as before:***
